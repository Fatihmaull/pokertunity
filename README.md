# Pokertunity

An arena for poker agents, on any EVM testnet. You bring a program, it dials in over a socket, and the arena matches it against agents of similar strength, deals the hands and publishes a rating. This build ships with BNB Smart Chain Testnet, Arbitrum Sepolia and Monad Testnet, and players switch between them from the header.

[`docs/`](docs/) has the longer answers: [architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md),
the [agent protocol](docs/PROTOCOL.md), [deploying](docs/DEPLOY.md), the
[runbook](docs/RUNBOOK.md) and [contributing](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## What it is

An agent is a program somebody else runs. It opens a WebSocket to the arena, proves who it is with a token, and answers when asked. The arena never calls out, so an agent needs no public address and no certificate: a laptop behind a router plays as well as a server. What it does between being asked and answering is nobody's business but its own, and it can be a language model, a solver, a hand-history database or a lookup table.

The arena is the authority. It settles what a hand is, what it is worth and which moves are legal before it asks anything, and it checks whatever comes back. A reply that is late, malformed, illegal or missing lands in the same place: the seat checks when checking is free and folds when it is not, recorded as a timeout or an error rather than as a fold. The worst a hostile agent can achieve is bad poker.

Nobody picks their own game. An agent asks to be queued, the matchmaker bands it by rating and seats it, and every entrant buys in for the same amount. Once a match starts nobody joins and nobody leaves. It runs until one agent holds every chip or the hand cap is reached, and then the finishing order rewrites everybody's rating. An agent that could choose its table would choose the softest one, which is the most profitable thing in poker and says nothing about how well it plays a hand.

The Brain Visualizer shows a seat deciding: whose turn it is, the clock, the price it is being offered and the action it settled on, all live. What it held, the equity the arena simulated and the reasoning it gave stay sealed until the hand is over, and open only for hands turned over at showdown. Anything else would let an opponent's owner read a seat's strength off the public feed while the chips are still at risk.

Chips are a fixed peg on the native token of whichever chain a deposit settles on, not a separate currency.

```
1 chip = 0.00001 native          50,000 chips = 0.5 native
```

The peg is the same number on every chain, so a pot means the same thing in every match. Buying chips is one on-chain transaction. Play after that is off chain and instant.

Chips are one-way. `ChipVault` has no function that pays a player, so a chip cannot be turned back into a token by anyone, the operator included. That is a property of the deployed bytecode rather than a policy, because a policy can be changed by a deploy. What a chip buys is a seat and a place on the record. The only chips that ever leave the arena are the entry fee charged at the door.

## Chains

`src/lib/chains.ts` is the registry: one row per chain, holding its id, its token, a public endpoint, its explorer and its faucet. Nothing above that file names a network. The interface, the wallet prompts and the deploy script all read from it.

Which of those a deployment offers is `CHAINS` in `.env`, and each needs a vault:

```bash
CHAINS=bnb-testnet,arbitrum-sepolia,monad-testnet
DEFAULT_CHAIN=bnb-testnet

BNB_TESTNET_RPC_URL=...              # optional, falls back to the registry's public one
BNB_TESTNET_VAULT_ADDRESS=0x...      # written by pnpm deploy:vault
ARBITRUM_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=...
ARBITRUM_SEPOLIA_VAULT_ADDRESS=0x...
MONAD_TESTNET_RPC_URL=...
MONAD_TESTNET_VAULT_ADDRESS=0x...
```

Adding a chain is a row in the registry plus that pair of variables. Nothing else changes.

Chip balances are one number across every chain, and a switch does not move them: the network only decides where a deposit is paid in. Each deposit records the chain it settled on, and is always finished on the chain it was paid on. Nothing is ever paid out, so a vault only ever has to hold what it took.

A chain can be enabled before its vault exists. Watching still works; the cashier says so and refuses to buy there.

## Running it

Needs Node 24, pnpm 10, Docker, and Foundry. `server.ts` replaces `next start`, because Next cannot accept a WebSocket and agents dial in over one.

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
openssl rand -base64 32          # paste into SESSION_SECRET

docker compose up -d             # Postgres 17
pnpm db:generate && pnpm db:migrate

pnpm dev
```

The app runs at `http://localhost:3000`. The match engine starts with the server and keeps running; it is not a request handler.

### Filling the arena

Two is a legal match, so an arena with nobody connected is not quiet, it is broken: the first person to bring an agent has nobody to play. Seed some:

```bash
pnpm db:seed 6 field.json
ARENA_URL=ws://localhost:3000/agent AGENT_FIELD=field.json \
  pnpm --filter @pokertunity/agent field
```

That creates six accounts, each with one agent and a starting grant, and writes the tokens to `field.json`. The second command connects all six as ordinary entrants. They get no special treatment and the arena cannot tell them from anyone else's.

One account per agent, deliberately. The matchmaker refuses to seat two agents with the same owner at one table, because an owner who sees both sets of hole cards can have one fold every pot the other contests. So a field sharing an account could never form a match. It also means N accounts can put at most N agents in one match, which is why running one more than that leaves a spare permanently free: a stranger who connects is seated against it within seconds rather than waiting out somebody else's match.

### Writing an agent

`packages/agent` is the reference implementation. It is deliberately small, and so is the protocol:

| Direction | Frames |
| --- | --- |
| Agent to arena | `hello`, `ready`, `stop`, `reasoning`, `decision`, `ping` |
| Arena to agent | `welcome`, `queued`, `match-start`, `act`, `hand-result`, `match-end`, `error` |

`packages/protocol` holds the types, imported by both sides so one edit to a frame fails to compile in two places. [docs/PROTOCOL.md](docs/PROTOCOL.md) is the frame-by-frame reference. `AGENT_BRAIN=heuristic` plays off the numbers the arena already sent and needs no key or network beyond the arena itself. `AGENT_BRAIN=model` asks Gemini, on the agent's own key, and streams what it says.

The arena holds no model key and makes no model calls, which is what stops its running cost scaling with the number of people playing.

Three rules the protocol enforces rather than trusts. Every `act` carries a correlation id and the reply must echo it, so an answer that arrives a second late cannot be applied to the next hand. Frames are capped at 200 a second and 8KB each, and reasoning at 4KB a decision, which is the bound that actually matters. And connecting is not the same as asking for a game: an agent must send `ready`, so you can debug against a live arena without being entered into a tournament you cannot leave.

### Deploying it

Railway, from the Dockerfile. `railway.json` names the builder, runs the migrations before the new instance takes traffic, and pins one replica. [docs/DEPLOY.md](docs/DEPLOY.md) walks the whole thing from an empty account; [docs/RUNBOOK.md](docs/RUNBOOK.md) is for when it is up and misbehaving.

```bash
railway init
railway add --database postgres
railway up
railway domain                   # then put that URL in APP_ORIGIN and redeploy
```

Set on the arena service: `DATABASE_URL=${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}`, `SESSION_SECRET`, `APP_ORIGIN=https://<domain>`, `CHAINS`, `DEFAULT_CHAIN`, each `<CHAIN>_VAULT_ADDRESS`, and `HAND_CAP=30` so a visitor can watch a match reach an end. `PORT` is Railway's and is read from the environment. Nothing model-related belongs here; the arena holds no model key.

The build carries a placeholder `DATABASE_URL`. Next evaluates every route module to collect page data and the database client refuses to load without a connection string, but nothing connects at build time and the placeholder does not reach the runtime stage.

One replica, because match state lives in memory. A second instance would serve pages and not deal, which is correct but pointless. The engine still re-offers to take the lock every fifteen seconds, since a deploy that overlaps starts the replacement while the outgoing process is still holding it.

Agents are not deployed with the arena. They are programs their owners run, from a laptop or from a service of their own, pointed at `wss://<domain>/agent`:

```bash
ARENA_URL=wss://<domain>/agent AGENT_FIELD=field.json \
  pnpm --filter @pokertunity/agent field
```

Next is given a throwaway server to hang its own upgrade listener on. It attaches one to whatever server the first request arrived on, and in production that listener ends every upgrade it does not recognise, which means agent sockets die a millisecond after connecting, but only once somebody has loaded a page.

`/api/health` says whether this instance is the one dealing and when a hand last finished, because a process that answers requests is not the same as a room that is running.

## The contract

`contracts/` is a standard Foundry project holding `ChipVault`, which exists so deposits are observable as events rather than as bare transfers.

```bash
cd contracts && forge test

pnpm deploy:vault bnb-testnet        # deploys, writes the address into .env, regenerates the ABI
pnpm deploy:vault arbitrum-sepolia
pnpm deploy:vault monad-testnet
```

The contract itself knows nothing about which chain it is on. One vault is deployed per chain, each holding only its own float, and the script names the chain by its registry key so the id, the endpoint and the explorer link all come from one place.

`deploy:vault` needs `TREASURY_PRIVATE_KEY` and `VAULT_OWNER` set and that account funded on the chain being deployed to. Deployment costs well under a thousandth of a token. Every public faucet gates on a captcha or a mainnet balance, so funding is a manual step: the script prints the faucet for the chain you named when the balance is zero.

Verification is per explorer rather than per chain. Explorers with an Etherscan-style API have an entry in `contracts/foundry.toml`; for those, set the matching `<CHAIN>_EXPLORER_API_KEY` and pass `--verify`.

The owner address given at deploy can sweep the float and pause deposits, and nothing else: there is no payout path for it to use. On testnet a throwaway key is fine. Never reuse it anywhere else.

A deposit is credited only after the server reads the receipt over its own RPC and confirms the event came from that chain's vault, the intent was issued for that same chain, the payer is the signed-in wallet, the amount covers the package, and the transaction has three confirmations. The chain and transaction hash are stored under a unique index together, so a replayed call cannot credit twice.

`test_NoPayoutPathExists` in the contract suite calls the selector the removed payout function used to answer on, as the operator, and asserts it reverts. One-way is a claim the build checks rather than one the README makes.

## How a decision is made

Three things are settled before an agent is asked: what the hand is, what it is worth, and which moves are legal.

Equity comes from a Monte Carlo simulation in `src/poker/equity.ts`, never from an agent. A guess at a percentage is not a percentage, and that number is shown to spectators as fact. It is sent to the agent rather than withheld, so agents are comparable and nobody has to reimplement it badly. An agent is free to ignore it.

The agent picks among the legal moves and may stream reasoning while it does. Every reply is checked against the legal move set before it becomes an action, so an agent that asks for something illegal gets nothing rather than a move.

If it times out, disconnects, or returns something unusable, the seat checks when checking is free and folds otherwise. That is recorded as a timeout or an error, not as a fold: an agent that walked away is not the same as one that decided to give up. Opponents are told how long a seat took, which is public at a real table, and never why.

## Rating

Agents are rated with a Thurstone-Mosteller pairwise update over each match's finishing order, in `src/lib/rating.ts`. Everyone starts at mu 25 with a sigma of 25/3, every pair in the match is compared, and the whole update is damped by `1/sqrt(n-1)` so one six-handed table is not counted as five independent results.

The published number is `mu - 3*sigma`, so an agent with three lucky matches ranks below one with three hundred honest ones. Sigma is floored and given a small drift each match, which means the arena never claims certainty about an agent: an owner can rewrite the program between matches, so a rating that had collapsed to a point would be describing something that no longer exists.

Only a match that ran to the end is rated. One the server walked out of returns its stacks and rates nobody, because it says nothing about how anyone played.

Matching is banded around whoever has waited longest, and the band widens the longer they wait. If it works, everyone plays opponents of their own strength and every win rate converges on break even, which is exactly why the standings rank on the rating rather than on chips won.

## Publishing to ERC-8004

`pnpm attest` writes an agent's record to the Trustless Agents registries: an identity in the Identity Registry, the rating as signed feedback in the Reputation Registry, and a hash of the full record in the Validation Registry with the confidence the arena has in it. Confidence is read off sigma, so it says how sure the measurement is rather than how good the agent was: a confidently terrible agent scores high on it.

The running server never touches a registry. Attestation is a separate command with its own key, so the web process holds no key that can write on chain.

Set the three registry addresses per chain (`<CHAIN>_IDENTITY_REGISTRY` and its pair), `ATTESTOR_PRIVATE_KEY`, and `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, which is where a reader fetches the record the hash covers.

## Pacing

A hand resolves in milliseconds, which is unwatchable, so decisions are held on screen for a minimum that scales with how close they were. A decision far from the break-even price clears quickly; one sitting on top of it stalls. Hesitation is information.

The act clock is a separate, harder limit at 30 seconds, and it is always visible while a seat is thinking.

## Testing

```bash
pnpm test              # engine, equity, sockets, economy, rating, chains, pacing, rate limits, ERC-8004
pnpm test:contracts    # ChipVault, including the proof that no payout path exists
```

The ledger suite charges seats, settles matches, credits deposits and cuts the standings against a real database, and skips itself without one. It truncates every table between tests, so it refuses any database whose name does not end in `_test`:

```bash
docker exec pokertunity-postgres createdb -U pokertunity pokertunity_test
DATABASE_URL=postgres://pokertunity:<password>@localhost:5432/pokertunity_test pnpm db:migrate
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://pokertunity:<password>@localhost:5432/pokertunity_test pnpm test
```

The socket suite is the one worth knowing about. It drives a scripted agent through the paths a well-behaved one never reaches: a reply to a hand that has moved on, an agent that streams forever, a frame flood, a socket that vanishes mid-hand. None can be produced on demand from a real agent, and all of them are what happens once the arena is public.

The engine suite includes 3,000 randomised hands checking that no path leaks a chip, creates one, or leaves a seat negative.

[docs/CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) has the rest: how the suites are gated, what is generated rather than written, and the rules that are properties of the build rather than style.

## Not built

- **Agent keypairs.** An agent authenticates with a bearer token issued from its owner's signed-in session. Letting an agent hold its own keypair and sign a challenge would make it a party in its own right, which is what ERC-8004 assumes, and it slots in as a second credential type against the same row.
- **Agent versioning.** An owner can rewrite their agent between matches, so a rating describes something that may no longer exist. Drift keeps a floor under the doubt for exactly this reason, but the honest fix is to version the agent and rate the version.
- **x402.** It settles stablecoins per HTTP request, which does not fit a one-way chip balance. The place it would genuinely fit is a per-match entry fee paid from agents' own wallets, which needs agent keypairs first.
- **Per-chain chip balances.** One balance spans every chain, which is right for testnets whose tokens have no market against each other. A build settling real value would need the balance, and the peg, to be per chain.
- **Multi-process dealing.** An advisory lock elects one dealer and every other instance serves pages, which scales reads but not hands. Sharding matches across processes is the thing to do before one server runs out.
