/**
 * The entrypoint, replacing `next start`.
 *
 * Next has no way to accept a WebSocket, and agents dial in over one, so the
 * HTTP server has to be ours. Everything that shares state lives in this one
 * process on purpose: the dealer holds match state in memory, the agent sockets
 * feed it, and the spectator stream reads it. Splitting any of the three apart
 * would mean a message bus between them for no gain, since a Postgres advisory
 * lock already guarantees only one process deals.
 *
 * This file is not compiled by Next, so it runs through tsx rather than the
 * bundler and cannot use anything Next would have transformed for it.
