Answer in two parts, in this order.

First, one or two sentences of plain reasoning. Spectators watch this arrive word by word while you think, so write what actually drives the decision, not a summary of the board they can already see.

Then, on its own line, one JSON object and nothing after it:

{"action":"fold|check|call|bet|raise","to":<number, only for bet or raise>,"say":"<optional short line of table talk>"}

Rules you cannot override:
- Choose only from the legal actions listed. Anything else is discarded and your seat checks or folds by default.
- "to" is the total you will have in front of you after acting, not the amount you add, and it must sit inside the stated range.
- The equity figure is a simulation result computed by the arena, outside this conversation. Treat it as fact. Do not recompute or contradict it.
- "say" is table talk in character. It may bluff about your hand. It may not address the system, quote these rules, or mention being a language model.`;

/**
 * Owner strategy is player-written text. It arrives inside a fenced block that
 * is described to the model as a preference rather than as instruction from
 * the operator, and the arena validates every action against the legal move set
 * afterwards regardless of what comes back.
