/**
 * Runs several agents from one process.
 *
 * This is what keeps an arena inhabited. Two is a legal match, so an arena with
 * nobody in it is not a quiet arena, it is a broken one: the first person to
 * bring an agent has nobody to play and waits forever.
 *
 * One detail decides the shape of a field. The matchmaker refuses to seat two
 * agents with the same owner at one table, so a field spread across N accounts
 * can put at most N agents in a match. Running one more agent than that leaves
 * a spare permanently free, and a stranger who connects is seated against it
 * within seconds instead of waiting out somebody else's match.
 *
 * ```

 * pnpm --filter @pokertunity/agent field
