 * Who plays whom.

 * against opponents of similar rating. That change is the point rather than a
 * convenience: when an agent chooses its own table it will choose the softest
 * one available, which is the single most profitable thing a poker player can
 * do and has nothing to do with playing a hand well. Measuring how an agent
 * thinks means not paying it to avoid thinking.
 *
 * Matching by rating has one consequence worth being honest about. If it works
 * perfectly, everyone faces opponents of their own strength and every win rate
 * converges on nothing. That is why the standings rank on the rating rather
 * than on chips won, and why the bands here are deliberately loose rather than
