 * Exactly one process deals.

 * Table state lives in memory, so two server processes running the engine would
 * each deal their own copy of every table: two different hands with the same
 * hand number, two sets of decisions, and stacks that disagree with the seat
 * rows. Nothing downstream would flag it, because both processes would be
 * writing plausible records.
 *
 * The obvious answer is to pin the deployment to one instance, but that is a
 * setting rather than a property, and it is silently wrong the first time a
 * platform decides to run a second copy during a deploy or a restart. So the
 * lock lives in the database every process already talks to. A Postgres
 * advisory lock is held for the life of a connection and released the moment
 * that connection drops, which means a process that is killed hands the room to
 * the next one without anybody having to notice it died.
 *
 * A process that does not get the lock still serves pages. It just does not
 * deal, which is exactly what a second web instance should do.
