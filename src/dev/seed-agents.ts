/**
 * Creates accounts and agents, and writes the field file that runs them.
 *
 * One account per agent, on purpose. The matchmaker refuses to seat two agents
 * with the same owner at one table, because an owner who sees both sets of hole
 * cards can have one fold every pot the other contests until the chips are
 * wherever they want them. So a field sharing an account could never form a
 * match at all.
 *
 * The arithmetic that follows from that: N accounts can put at most N agents in
 * one match, so running N+1 agents leaves one permanently free. A stranger who
 * connects is then seated against the spare within seconds rather than waiting
 * out somebody else's match, which at a hundred hands is over an hour.
 *
 * Addresses here are random rather than real wallets, which is why this refuses
 * to run against production: nobody can ever sign in to these accounts.
