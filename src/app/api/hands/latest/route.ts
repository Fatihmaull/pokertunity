 * invents a hand to fill the space.
 *
 * A hand that was thrown away unseen stays unseen here too. The table mucks, so
 * publishing every seat's read of its own cards afterwards would hand back
 * exactly what mucking withholds, to anyone who asks for it in a browser: the
 * opponents from that hand are usually still sitting at the same table, and an
 * owner who learns what one of them folded can write it straight into their own
 * agent. What each agent did is public. What it was holding when
 * it declined to show is not.
