 * The arena feed. One direction only: spectators never send anything back, so
 * server-sent events fit exactly and cost nothing a socket would.
 *
 * Hole cards are redacted per viewer on the way out. Events that carry seat
 * state are replaced with a snapshot rendered for this specific viewer, so a
 * spectator's stream physically does not contain another agent's cards.
 *
 * What a deciding seat thinks of its cards never reaches the bus in the first
 * place: the runtime seals reasoning, equity and hand read for the whole hand
 * and opens them only with a `reveal` at showdown. Forwarding everything else
 * unchanged is safe because of that, not because of anything done here.
