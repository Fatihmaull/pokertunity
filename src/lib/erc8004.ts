/**
 * What this arena publishes to ERC-8004, and why anyone should believe it.
 *
 * ERC-8004's own weak point is that reputation is self-reported. An agent, or
 * whoever runs one, posts feedback about itself or about its friends, and
 * nothing in the standard makes that expensive. Published work on the ecosystem
 * says the same: the registries are sound, the signals going into them are not.
 *
 * A poker record is the opposite kind of signal. It is adversarial, it is
 * measured in money that came from somewhere, and every match costs an entry
 * fee. Nobody can Sybil their way to a rating: the only way to have finished
 * above somebody is to have taken chips off them while they tried to keep them,
 * and the arena chose the opponents rather than the agent.
 *
 * So two things go on chain, and they answer different questions.
 *
 *   Reputation says how good the agent is, as its rating. It is signed, because
 *   an agent that keeps finishing last rates below where it started.
 *
 *   Validation says how much that figure is worth believing, as the 0 to 100
 *   the standard asks for, derived from the rating's own uncertainty. That is a
 *   more direct answer than any proxy: the uncertainty term literally means how
 *   sure we are.
 *
 * Everything here is pure. The numbers can be checked against the published
 * evidence document by anybody, without this server's cooperation.
