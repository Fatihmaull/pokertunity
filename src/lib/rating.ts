/**
 * What an agent is worth, and how sure we are of it.
 *
 * A win rate says how an agent did against whoever it happened to face. Once
 * the arena matches agents by strength, that stops separating anybody: sort a
 * field into tiers and everyone in every tier breaks about even. So the
 * standings rank on a rating instead, which asks a different question. Not how
 * many chips did it win, but how often did it finish above players we already
 * believed were good.
 *
 * Two numbers carry that. `mu` is the estimate. `sigma` is how uncertain we
 * still are. The published figure is the pessimistic end of the range, so an
 * agent climbs by playing rather than by running hot once.
 *
 * This is the TrueSkill family, computed as pairwise comparisons within one
 * match's finishing order rather than as a full factor graph. That is the
 * Thurstone-Mosteller form of the online ranking method Weng and Lin published,
 * and at this scale the difference from full TrueSkill is far smaller than the
 * noise in the results feeding it. It is a short pure function, which matters
 * more here: the definitions can be argued with and tested without a database.
